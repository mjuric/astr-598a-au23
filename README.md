## Class Description

This course will introduce you to concepts, tools, and and techniques from
statistics and computer science that are essential for accurate and
reproducible analysis of datasets, large and small.  Through a series of
lectures and hands-on problems, we will learn about elementary statistics,
maximum likelihood methods, Bayesian probability and inference, MCMC
methods, databases, and time series analysis.  Practical data analysis will
be done using Python, including astroML, astropy, astroquery and others.

The goal of this course is to give you the basic skills necessary to
understand and correctly analyze rich datasets, from Kepler to LSST.  It
will also give you the theoretical foundations needed to successfully
proceed to ASTR 597 Machine Learning in Astronomy (to be offered in the
Winter quarter).
